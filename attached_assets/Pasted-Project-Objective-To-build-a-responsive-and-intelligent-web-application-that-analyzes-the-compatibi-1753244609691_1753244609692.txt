Project Objective:
To build a responsive and intelligent web application that analyzes the compatibility between a candidate‚Äôs resume and a job description using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The system should provide a match score, a section-wise analysis, skill gap identification, and recommendations for improving the resume for better alignment with the job description.

üë©‚Äçüíª Target Users:
Job Seekers

Employers/Recruiters

Career Coaches

HR Professionals

üß± Technology Stack:
Frontend:
React.js (UI framework)

TailwindCSS / Material-UI (UI styling)

Axios (for API calls)

Backend:
Node.js + Express.js

Multer (for file upload)

JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication

Database:
MongoDB (NoSQL) for storing users, resumes, job descriptions, match history

NLP Layer (can be integrated as a microservice or in Node backend):
Python with SpaCy, NLTK, or Transformers (BERT, SBERT)

OR JavaScript NLP libraries (if full MERN-only implementation is required) like natural, compromise, wink-nlp (limited but usable)

üîê User Roles:
Admin: Manage users, view analytics

Job Seeker: Upload resume and view compatibility results

Employer: Upload job descriptions, view top matching resumes (future feature)

üß∞ Core Functional Modules:
1. Authentication and User Management:
Sign Up / Login (Email + Password)

Google OAuth (optional)

JWT-based session management

Role-based access (Job Seeker vs Employer)

2. Resume Upload Module:
Upload PDF/DOCX/TXT or paste resume in text area

File parsing using pdf-parse, docx, or textract

Extract sections:

Contact Info

Skills

Work Experience

Education

Certifications

Projects / Keywords

3. Job Description Upload Module:
Paste or upload JD in text or document format

Extract key components using NLP:

Required Skills

Responsibilities

Preferred Experience

Education & Certifications

4. NLP-Based Compatibility Analysis:
a. Text Preprocessing:
Tokenization

Lemmatization

Stopword removal

POS tagging (for skills & experience detection)

b. Matching Algorithm:
Skill Matching (direct and synonym-based)

Experience Matching (years, role relevance)

Education & Certification Match

Keyword & Semantic Match using:

TF-IDF + Cosine Similarity

OR BERT embeddings for semantic comparison

c. Scoring Metrics:
Total Compatibility Score (out of 100)

Section-wise scores:

Skills Match %

Experience Match %

Education Match %

Match Confidence (Low, Medium, High)

5. Result Visualization:
Display match score and badge

Color-coded charts (Pie/Bar) for section match

Highlight missing skills or mismatched items

Recommendations for improving resume

6. CSV Upload Module (Optional):
Upload multiple resumes or JDs for batch analysis

Show top matches and generate downloadable reports

üìä Frontend UI Pages (React.js):
Home/Landing Page

Login/Signup Page

Dashboard (Role-based)

Resume Upload Page

Job Description Upload Page

Analysis Result Page

Match History Page

Settings/Profile Page
